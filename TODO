Try different hashing functions (current: crc64), e.g murmur
Change DB model from struct row
	typedef struct{
		char path[MAXPATH];
		char tags[MAXTAGS];
		uint16_t lenTags;
		uint16_t numTags;
	} row;
to tables of ids
	images[]	tags[]	images:tags[]

DONE	Try to improve 'sameStr' by maybe not having to check s2[i2]
