DONE	Try to improve 'sameStr' by maybe not having to check s2[i2]
When developed more, check if its better to us "strInTags" or "BM" for applicable uses
Measure performance with
	struct timespec t0, t1;
        if(timespec_get(&t0, TIME_UTC) != TIME_UTC) {
                printf("Error in calling timespec_get\n");
                exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        //measure these two
        int a = strInTags(str, l, "percent", 7, ';');
        int a = BM("percent", 7, str, l);

        if(timespec_get(&t1, TIME_UTC) != TIME_UTC) {
                printf("Error in calling timespec_get\n");
                exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
        // Calculate the elapsed time
        double diff = (double)(t1.tv_sec - t0.tv_sec) + ((double)(t1.tv_nsec - t0.tv_nsec)/1000000000L);
        printf("Elapsed time: %lf seconds\n", diff);
